            <p> 
                Hi, my name is Pauleena Phan and I am 21 years old. I currently attend California State University of Fullerton 
                and I am graduating this semester, Spring 2024. I am a computer science major and coding can sometimes be fun.

            <h2> Cats </h2>
            <p> 
                Like a normal human being I like a lot of things. I like cats a lot and I have four of them. Down below you can 
                see my cute cats. Bean is the mom and we got her in around October 2021. In 2022 she gave birth to four more cats 
                but we gave one of them away. My favorite cat would have to be Rocky. I think he likes me the most and he is a little 
                dumb but, I still love him.

            <h2> Festivals </h2>
            <p> EDM would have to be my favorite area of music. I like to go to a lot of festivals with friends and have a good time. 
                My favorite festival so far would have to be Countdown 2023. It was the most memorable for me.

            <h2> Fried Chicken </h2>
            <p> 
                
                Fried chicken has been in my life since I was born. It has to be one of my favorite things to eat because it taste good. 
                My favorite fried chicken places that have a strong place in my heart would have to be: 
            </p>
            <div id="chickenPlaces">
                <p> Pelicana Chicken </p>

            <h2> Favorite Movie: Minions </h2>
            <p> 
                As a kid this was always my favorite movie. I loved the descicable me series and the minions series. My favorite thing 
                about the movies would be the minions. I just think that they are so funny and they make me laugh. The plot and characters 
                are not boring so it has to be one of my favorite movie series.

            <h1> Hobbies </h1>
            <h2> Painting </h2>
            <p> 
                I usually don't paint that much but I enjoy it when I do. I mainly like painting for other people rather than myself. 
                It brings me satisfation and i'm not sure why. My favorite things to paint would be cartoon or animated characters. 
                I did take a painting class with my best friend in first grade and I think that paved the way for a interest in drawing and painting. 
                After that painting class I took more drawing classes in middle and high school. It made me love art and drawing even
                more but I only like doing it when I have control over what I am creating and doing it in my free time. I'm not that 
                good at it but I enjoy it.
            </p>

            <h2> Hobbies I started but didn't get deep into</h2>
            <h3> Croteching </h3>
            <p>
                I thought looked really cool to see other people make plushes or clothes from crotech and I wanted to try myself. I tried to make a sweater
                but I think that was a bad idea because I never finished it and it demotivated me from touching crotech again. I do want to try again
                and make a small hat or something but, I been pretty lazy. This is definetly a hobby that I want to get back into again.
            </p>

            <h3> Making keyboards </h3>
            <p>
                Making keyboards is probably one of the funniest and exspensive hobbies to have. I made my first one two years ago for my boyfriend's birthday.
                My friend and brother helped me out and it turned out really good. It's super fun looking for a board and switches that you like and customizing
                it to your liking. There are so many options and you get full control over what you what for your board. I would get back into it but only when
                I have a stable job so I won't go broke.

            <h1> Achievements</h1>
            <h2> Health </h2>
            <p>
                In 2023 I wanted to lose weight and I was able to achieve my goal and I lost around 25 pounds. I was super proud of the results and myself for staying
                consistent. I started off by going to the gym but just doing cardio like walking around the track. This was a big step for me because I would go to school
                and stay in the library during my breaks. At home I was always on my computer so I wasn't that active. As I went to the gym I slowly fixed my diet.
                I realized how much calories I was eating and the stuff I was eating. I tracked my calories and layed off some of the junk food and sugary drinks.
                This was super important to my weightloss and I instantly saw progress. 
            </p>

            <p>
                As I was losing weight and reaching my goal I wanted to build muscle. So I started weightlifting and using the machines. I went to the gym two times a week
                and weightlifted. I wasn't seeing a lot of progress until I learned that I needed more protein in my body. So I started to meal prep for the week and add more 
                protein into my diet. I saw a good amount of progress doing this and I been consistent ever since. It is 2024 and I am still going to the gym and I feel
                mentally and physically better. This changed my life a lot and definetly had to be one of the biggest achievements and positive change in my life.
